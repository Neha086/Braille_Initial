Based on the concept of capacitive sensing, a small project using arduino wherein alphabets/words can be printed according to the aluminium foil strips touched. The concept is to help the blind people write characters by touching the strips in a certain pattern according to braille. The corresponding pattern will be converted to English Alphabets and will be printed. 

Just a simple circuit on breadboard:
